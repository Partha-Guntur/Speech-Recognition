# Speech Recognition Project using Natural Language Processing(NLP)
## Overview

This project aims to implement a speech recognition system using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system will be designed to accurately transcribe spoken language into written text, enabling seamless interaction with digital devices through speech.

## Project Structure
### The project is organized into the following components:

1. Data Collection
Gathering a diverse set of audio recordings representing various languages, accents, and environmental conditions to train the speech recognition model.
2. Preprocessing
Utilizing techniques such as noise reduction, audio normalization, and feature extraction to prepare the audio data for input into the model.
3. Model Development
Implementing a deep learning model, potentially using recurrent neural networks (RNN) or transformer-based architectures, to accurately transcribe speech into text.
4. NLP Integration
Leveraging NLP techniques to improve the accuracy of transcriptions, including language modeling, contextual understanding, and entity recognition.
5. User Interface
Developing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the speech recognition system, potentially incorporating voice commands and real-time transcription capabilities.
6. Evaluation and Testing

Conducting rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the speech recognition system across diverse linguistic and environmental contexts.
